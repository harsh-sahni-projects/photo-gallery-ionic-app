# About

This is a photo taking application. You can do the following:

1. Click photo using Camera API of android/iOS/webcam.

2. Save photo and show the photos in the app itself.

3. Delete selected photos.

# Tech used

This is a PWA (Progressive Web App) which can run both on android and iOS. 

I have used Ionic and Capacitor frameworks to build this app.
